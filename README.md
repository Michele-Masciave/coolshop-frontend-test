# Homework

Taken the html structure in the example below (index.html),
write a simple React calculator (adder) su that has the following mandatory functionalities:

rows can be added and removed
each row have a sign (minus or plus)
each row can be enabled or disabled by a dedicated control button. Disabled rows must be excluded from the addition.
The result must be updated "live" while the user is writing
Feel free to add libraries if needed.

Structure and quality of the code, are matter of evaluation

ES6+ Javascript knowledge is matter of evaluation

Look and feel of the solution is a plus
